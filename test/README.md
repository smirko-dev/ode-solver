# Test

## Description

This minimal example calculates `y=sin(x)` by `dy(x)=cos(x)` in a range of `x=[0..1]`using the Euler, MidPoint and RungeKutta methods.

The program returs -1 in case of a comparison didn't match with an accepted error of `e=0.0001`.

The additional commandline argument `--silent` blocks the result output and just value mismatches are printed to console.
