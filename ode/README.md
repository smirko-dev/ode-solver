# ODE Solver

## OdeFunction

The function for an ODE solver needs to provide the derivative (1st and optional 2nd oder) of an equation.

The parameters are given in a single vector. The setParams and getParams methods implement the mapping of the parameters. 

## OdeSolver

The ODE solver provides an interface for certain implementationÂ´s.
